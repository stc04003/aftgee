\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula expression, of the form \code{response ~ predictors}.
The \code{response} is a \code{Surv} object object with right censoring.
See the documentation of \code{lm}, \code{coxph} and \code{formula} for details.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame in which to interpret the variables
occurring in the \code{formula}.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations
to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{id}{an optional vector used to identify the clusters.
If missing, then each individual row of \code{data} is presumed to
represent a distinct subject.
The length of \code{id} should be the same as the number of observation.}

\item{contrasts}{an optional list.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of observation weights.}

\item{B}{a numeric value specifies the resampling number.
When \code{B = 0} or \code{se = NULL}, only the beta estimate will be displayed.}

\item{rankWeights}{a character string specifying the type of general weights.
    The following are permitted:
\describe{
  \item{\code{logrank}}{logrank weight}
  \item{\code{gehan}}{Gehan's weight}
  \item{\code{PW}}{Prentice-Wilcoxon weight}
  \item{\code{GP}}{GP class weight}
  \item{\code{userdefined}}{a user defined weight provided as a vector
with length equal to the number of subject. This argument is still under-development.}
}}

\item{eqType}{a character string specifying the type of the
    estimating equation used to obtain the regression parameters.
    The following are permitted:
\describe{
  \item{\code{is}}{Regression parameters are estimated by directly solving the
induced-smoothing estimating equations. This is the default and recommended method.}
  \item{\code{ns}}{Regression parameters are estimated by directly solving the nonsmooth
estimating equations.}

monotonic smoothed Gehan-based estimating equations. This is typical when

monotonic non-smoothed Gehan-based estimating equations. This is typical when

\item{se}{a character string specifying the estimating method for the variance-covariance matrix.
  The following are permitted:

the variance-covariance matrix will not be computed.}

}}

\item{control}{controls equation solver, maxiter, tolerance, and resampling variance estimation.
The available equation solvers are \code{BBsolve} and \code{dfsane} of the \pkg{BB} package.
The default algorithm control parameters are used when these functions are called.
However, the monotonicity parameter, \code{M}, can be specified by users via the control list.
When \code{M} is specified, the merit parameter, \code{noimp}, is set at \deqn{10 * M}.
The readers are refered to the \pkg{BB} package for details.
Instead of searching for the zero crossing, options including \code{BBoptim} and \code{optim}
will return solution from maximizing the corresponding objective function.
When \code{se = "bootstrap"} or \code{se = "MB"},
an additional argument \code{parallel = TRUE} can be specified to
enable parallel computation.
The number of CPU cores can be specified with \code{parCl},
the default number of CPU cores is the integer value of \code{detectCores() / 2}.}
}

    \item{5}{indicates lack of improvement in objective function.}
  }
  \item{bhist}{When \code{variance = "MB"}, \code{bhist} gives the bootstrap samples.}
}

\description{
Fits a semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model with rank-based approach.
General weights, additional sampling weights and fast sandwich variance estimations
are also incorporated.
Estimating equations are solved with Barzilar-Borwein spectral method implemented as
\code{BBsolve} in package \pkg{BB}.
}
\details{
When \code{se = "bootstrap"} or \code{se = "MB"}, the variance-covariance matrix
is estimated through a bootstrap fashion.
Bootstrap samples that failed to converge are removed when computing the empirical variance matrix.
When bootstrap is not called, we assume the variance-covariance matrix has a sandwich form
\deqn{\Sigma = A^{-1}V(A^{-1})^T,}
where \eqn{V} is the asymptotic variance of the estimating function and
\eqn{A} is the slope matrix.
In this package, we provide seveal methods to estimate the variance-covariance
matrix via this sandwich form, depending on how \eqn{V} and \eqn{A} are estimated.
Specifically, the asymptotic variance, \eqn{V}, can be estimated by either a
closed-form formulation (\code{CF}) or through bootstrap the estimating equations (\code{MB}).
On the other hand, the methods to estimate the slope matrix \eqn{A} are
the inducing smoothing approach (\code{IS}), Zeng and Lin's approach (\code{ZL}),
and the smoothed Huang's approach (\code{sH}).
